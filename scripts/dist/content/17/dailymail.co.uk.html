        Egyptian canal authorities said the 220,000-ton Ever Given had been turned '80 per cent in the right direction' after the stern of the vessel was shifted with 'pulling manouevres' that moved it 335ft from the shore (as shown on the left). ootage showed boats blaring their horns and a tugboat captain giving a thumbs-up as rescuers celebrated their breakthrough (top right), with 11 boats taking advantage of a high tide brought on by the supermoon to partially refloat the ship. But it remained unclear how long it would take to fully re-open the canal, where hundreds of ships are waiting in a massive traffic jam with £6.5billion of global trade being held up each day after the ship's bow got jammed in the canal last week (bottom right). Egyptian lieutenant-general Osama Rabei said salvage crews would resume their attempts to pull the Panama-flagged ship into the middle of the waterway once high tide returns later on Monday morning.

      Cyclists and golfers were out at Midnight and swimmers doing lengths at dawn today as England tentatively stepped out of lockdown and straight into a three-day spring heatwave with temperatures hitting 70F (21C) this afternoon and 76F (24C) tomorrow. In a video address, Boris Johnson wished the country 'the very best of luck' and said he knows 'how hard it has been to be separated from your teammates and your coaches and the sports that you love', as England prepares to embark on the next stage of its roadmap to freedom today. As of today - dubbed 'Happy Monday' - up six people, or two full households - are allowed to meet outside, including in back gardens, for the first time in four months. But people are being urged not to hug their friends and family. The Government's 'stay at home' rule has been replaced with 'stay local' while its new mantra is now: 'Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air'. Golf, tennis and formally-organised team sports resume today with the 'exceptional circumstances'-only rule lifted for weddings, meaning anyone can now marry. Cycling groups went out together as the clocks struck midnight while others were in lidos swimming before dawn this morning. Golf courses were also getting busy at 6am.

            England will wake up to the first major relaxation of its January lockdown rules today. As the country reaches the next stage of Boris Johnson's roadmap out of lockdown, gatherings of up to six people - or two full households - are now allowed in parks or in back gardens. Golf, tennis and team sports are also able to resume - with the PM wishing 'the very best of luck' to those heading back to pitches, courts and fields. Here, MailOnline answers your most-pressing questions about what the latest lockdown rules (pictured) mean for you.

            Simon Bailey, who leads the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) on child protection, speculated that the school sex scandal has been fuelled by online pornography and the sexualisation of women. Yesterday the chief constable also revealed that police had already received 'in excess of 7,000' reports from people online. More than 100 schools have been named in thousands of harrowing anonymous testimonies on a website set up by former private school pupil Soma Sara, 22, to expose misogyny, harassment and assaults in schools. There have even been allegations of a 'rape culture' at some institutions, sparking a major Whitehall investigation into the growing scandal that has seen some of Britain's most elite schools named in accounts of sex abuse. Schools named on the Everyone's Invited website include Eton College, St Paul's School, Dulwich College, Westminster School and Highgate School.

        A poll of 3,200 students last year claimed that four per cent of British students were using sex work to fund their courses, while one in ten say they would do it in a 'cash emergency'.

            LORRAINE CANDY: When my teenage daughters first used the phrase 'rape culture' I warned them to be careful about deploying such emotive words. As a journalist who has covered several significant rape trials in my career, it jarred with me. Teenagers can be so dramatic, I thought. The expression came up as we discussed the website Everyone's Invited, which has come to prominence in recent weeks as a place where young women leave testimonies of sexual harassment, assault and abuse. But as the conversation continued I felt guilty for underestimating my 17 and 18-year-old girls. As they shared tale after tale of toxic misogyny among teenage boys, it became depressingly clear that neither of them was being dramatic. (Pictured left, Pupils stage a protest against rape culture at Highgate School in London, pictured right, Lorraine Candy.)

        Women made to feel 'uncomfortable or frightened' by people wolf-whistling at them should report the matter to police, says Louisa Rolfe, an assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police.

            Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, 43, (inset) drove to Scotland to see oil tycoon's daughter Lindsay Wallace, 40, (left) a close school friend of his sister Zara. Furious locals called the police when Peter appeared at Ms Wallace's £475,000 home in the village of St Cyrus in Aberdeenshire. Officers 'issued advice' when they spoke to the pair on Friday, but as Peter said he made the 460-mile journey on business he was found to be following the rules. Peter - who separated from his wife Autumn Phillips in 2019 - is said to be 'besotted' with Ms Wallace, who he has known for 'quite some time', sources claim. Ms Wallace is understood to have split from her husband.  She was pictured at Zara's wedding to rugby star Mike Tindall in 2011 (right, at the centre wearing a cream top and pink hat).

            The US tech entrepreneur, (left; and right, with the PM) who took a selfie in the kitchen of the £3.35million Grade-II townhouse, left just minutes before Marina Wheeler got home. The explosive claim was made by Miss Arcuri, 36, as she lifted the lid on her four-year affair with the then London Mayor. Mr Johnson told her one raunchy photograph she sent him was 'enough to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window'.

            Princess Diana was allegedly tricked into granting her Panorama interview after Martin Bashir showed her a faked abortion 'receipt' for royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke (right). The shocking claim is among bombshell evidence given to the inquiry into the BBC and Bashir (left). Retired Supreme Court judge Lord Dyson (inset) has interviewed 17 witnesses as he probes allegations the broadcaster covered up a trail of deceit by the journalist. Bashir is accused of peddling lies and vile smears to the vulnerable princess to land his explosive 1995 scoop, in which she famously proclaimed 'there were three of us in this marriage'. Diana was said to have been obsessed with the bizarre idea that Charles wanted her murdered in order to marry the nanny. The princess was so convinced Miss Legge-Bourke had become pregnant by Charles that an investigation was launched by Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen's private secretary and Diana's brother-in-law, after the princess allegedly approached Tiggy at a party and hissed: 'So sorry to hear about the baby.'

       Ex-police officer Nick Alexander shot dead two Islamist militants after breaking into a government vehicle and grabbing an AK-47 amid the bloodshed in Mozambique. Seven people, including a British contractor, were killed as they tried to flee the hotel siege in Palma, near the site of a £14billion major gas project. Philip Mawer (bottom right), a caterer from Somerset who works at the hotel compound, has also not been seen since the attack and is among an unknown number of expats who remain missing. Thousands of survivors evacuated by boat or plane on Sunday, with witnesses forced to wait on beaches strewn with headless bodies after the decapitations by the militants.

            The milestone comes as Britain's world-leading vaccination effort gets a lift next month with the arrival of a third vaccine. But France - despite lagging far behind in its vaccination drive - will catch up with Britain 'in a few weeks', president Emmanuel Macron (pictured, left) claimed today. Just 11.7 per cent of French adults - 6.1 million - have received one or more jabs, compared with 57 per cent of UK adults who have received their first jab - some 30,151,287 people. In addition, 3.5 million Britons have had their second doses.

            The Prime Minister was seen keeping his dog Dilyn (pictured right) close by during a run in London earlier today. The excitable Jack Russell was pictured going after ducks (pictured left) as the Conservative leader worked up a sweat in one of the capital's parks. Mr Johnson was pictured running as lockdown measures were eased in England today - on what is being dubbed 'Happy Monday'. From today, up six people, or two full households, are allowed to meet outside, including in back gardens, for the first time in four months.

            Abbie Quinnen has revealed the extent of the second-degree burns on her face (left and right) she suffered after a horrific fire accident. The professional dancer, 23, was left needing three skin grafts after a video she was filming with her boyfriend AJ Pritchard (inset) went horribly wrong and saw a wine bottle explode in January.  Abbie, who also suffered third-degree burns on her body, posed for photos taken before her skin grafts to highlight the burns which cover much of the right side of her face.

       Woody Allen has given his first TV interview in 30 years addressing allegations of sexual abuse by Dylan Farrow, maintaining his innocence while noting he thinks Farrow 'believes' she is telling the truth. The interview was conducted by CBS Sunday Morning reporter Lee Cowan in July 2020 but seemingly never aired and was mad available as part of a larger package on Paramount Plus on Sunday. The special was recorded before the release of Allen v. Farrow earlier this year in which his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow speaks on camera about her alleged sexual abuse and is unlikely to address the HBO's four-part docuseries.

        I'm 57 and have a final salary pension and want to know whether I can take 25 per cent and leave the rest. If I do have to remove it all together would I receive less than its current value?

Since announcing their relationship on Instagram (top left) in 2019, the pair have shared pictures of their matching protective face masks (bottom left), Brooklyn's proposal (centre), their love for high-end fashion (top right) and have also shared images of themselves having a bath (bottom right).

       A dietitian has shared her favourite healthy chicken taco bowl recipe (right), and it works perfectly as a meal prepped lunch through the week. Leanne Ward (left), from Brisbane, said she loves making the spicy chicken bowls on a Sunday ahead of a busy week at work, and will enjoy one fresh before boxing up the other three or four for lunches at her clinic from Monday.

       Police in Miami are searching for the person who sexually assaulted a boy, 12. The child was walking around 2am in the Brownsville area of northwest Miami when a man is said to have pulled up, forced the boy into a vehicle, and sexually assaulted him. The boy was then shot and forced out of the car to be dumped on the street. A passerby came to the boy's aide and called the emergency services. Surveillance footage shows the boy collapsing, bleeding from a head wound while a person standing next to him calls 911.

       Donald Trump was set to make a toast at a wedding being held at his country club but ended up talking about losing the 2020 election and the border crisis. The former president was making a guest appearance at a wedding reception at his Mar-a-Lago resort for the newly married couple John and Megan Arrigo. Instead of talking about the newlyweds, he used the occasion to take a dig at President Joe Biden's administration. Before putting down the mic after two-and-a-half minutes he asked guests if they missed him resulting in cheers from those invited to the nuptials.

       The masked burglar had only made his way underneath the shutters of Spice Village in Southall, west London before he fled after being scared off by night-time cleaners. The owners of the restaurant, rated second best in Southall, said the incident was a 'lucky' escape after several of their neighbours had suffered burglaries.

       Lil Nas X has come under fire from conservative voices after releasing a pair of Nike 'Satan Shoes,' of which only 666 pairs have been made. Nas collaborated with streetwear company MSCHF on the sneakers which also contain a drop of human blood in the sole, drawn from members of the MSCHF team. The shoes are modified Nike Air Max 97s and contain a reference to the a Bible verse that tells of Satan's fall from heaven, Luke 10:18. The 666 pairs of footwear will be sold for $1,018 from Monday. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has said the 'soul of the nation's kids' is at stake. Apparel company Nike has distanced itself from the shoes emphasizing it had no input into their design. The shoes coincide with Lil Nas X's latest single which sees him seducing the Devil with a lap dance in a music video which has been viewed more than 29 million times since its release on Friday. On Sunday, the rapper, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, put out a short YouTube video titled 'Lil Nas X Apologizes for Satan Shoe', but instead of an apology the video showed the shoes and the Devil lap dance.

            Sunday night's Super Worm Moon is be the biggest and brightest moon of the year so far due to its proximity to earth - but you'll need to get a wriggle on if you want to see it. Worm Moon is the common name for March's full moon because at the time it appears the ground begins to soften and worms appear, bringing robins and other birds for the start of spring. The moon was 100 per cent full and at its brightest and biggest at 7.48pm BST last night.   Due to cloudy forecasts tonight some viewers missed the spectacle in all of its glory, however tonight is expected to bring clearer skies in the south and the moon will still be 99 per cent full.

            Tess Gridley (pictured, inset), a scientist from Sheffield, encountered the mass stranding at Muizenberg Beach in Cape Town, South Africa, while walking with her family. The 'evil-eyed' pufferfish (pictured left and right) are each armed with a poison more deadly than cyanide. Dr Gridley, who moved to Africa in 2009, estimated that hundreds had washed up. One dog was killed as a result of the mass stranding, according to the AfriOceans Conservation Alliance, a local NGO.

       Tourists on a river cruise in the Northern Territory in Australia have captured the moment two hungry crocs squared off over a tasty feed in the Adelaide river. The tour operator from the Queen Jumping Crocodile Tour was dangling a piece of meat attached to a rope and a pole when the feeding display took a sudden turn. The powerful Nifty flipped Turbo on his back and clamped down on his stomach, viciously flinging him around. Skipper Steven Pitkin, said the ambush was a surprise for everyone on board as 'we didn't know Nifty was in the area.'

            Max Woosey (pictured, left and right, and with his parents, inset), from Braunton, Devon, began his challenge after a neighbour, who later died of cancer, gave him a tent to 'have an adventure in'. Children as far away as north America and Singapore took part in the Saturday night camp-out. By Sunday, Max had raised more than £500,000 for charity.

            The pilot was soaring over the millionaire's playground of Sandbanks in Dorset at 1.25pm today when strong gusts blew him off course and into the 60ft tree. The coastguard rushed to the scene along with crews from the fire and ambulance service. A team of specialists were able to lower the stricken surfer safely to the ground as well as his kite. He was then treated by the paramedics but his injuries are not thought to be serious.
